# Development Setup


## Development using docker
```
git clone https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT
cd AGiXT
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

## Development using poetry

Clone the repository for the AGiXT back end and start it.

#### Install poetry
`pip install poetry==1.5.0`

Check if poetry is available via

`poetry --version`

or

`python3 -m poetry --version`

Adapt the following commands accordingly.

#### Setup AGiXT
```
git clone https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT
pip install poetry==1.5.0
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
cd AGiXT
poetry install --with gpt4free
playwright install
```

#### Run Streamlit 
`poetry run streamlit run Main.py`

#### Run REST
`poetry run uvicorn app:app --port 7437`


Access the web interface at http://localhost:8501

### API Endpoints

AGiXT provides several API endpoints for managing agents, prompts and chains.

If you're not running with Docker, the back end can be run with:
```
python agixt/app.py
```

To learn more about the API endpoints and their usage, visit the API documentation at 
- [Swagger](http://localhost:7437)
- [Redoc](http://localhost:7437/redoc)

This documentation is hosted locally and the frontend must be running for these links to work.
